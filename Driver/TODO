// TODO
// keep app running in tray with little icon? (profile first letter or index in the icon?) - check
// listen to hotkey and change profile based on it - check although kind of incompatible with process based as we fallback to default profile when no processes of a profile are matched
// ability to remove profiles - check
// change profile based on app in foreground - check
// remember selected profile accross process starts - check although useless
// export profiles
// change RT and turbo based on profile
// change lighting based on active profile? Need to link profiles together somehow?
